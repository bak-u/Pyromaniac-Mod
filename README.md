# Pyromaniac Mod
 
Hi there! I'm bak-u and this is my first Minecraft Forge mod. So, be kind, I'm a novice :D.

## Mod description

It's easy: 

Wanna start lots of fires at the same time?

Welcome, this is your mod :D

## Mod commands

- **/pyro start**	 - Starts the targeting function. Just right-click the blocks you want to set on fire.
- **/pyro stop**	 - Stop targeting. You're almost done.
- **/pyro fire**	 - Fires all the targeted blocks at the same time. **For your security, you must call this command twice.**
